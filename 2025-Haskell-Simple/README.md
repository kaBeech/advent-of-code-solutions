# Advent Of Code 2025 Solutions!

This year I'm taking it easy; just doing the puzzles the regular way in
Haskell (as opposed to doing [Xtreme Xmas Code](https://www.xtremexmascode.com/) as I did for the past 2 years).

I will work on writing code in a readable way as I'm hoping to show off some of
Haskell's niceties to my coworkers 😸
