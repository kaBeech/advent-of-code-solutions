# Advent Of Code 2025 Solutions!

This year I'm taking it easy; just doing the puzzles the regular way in
Haskell (as opposed to doing [Xtreme Xmas Code](https://www.xtremexmascode.com/) as I did for the past 2 years).

I will work on writing code in a readable way as I'm hoping to show off some of
Haskell's niceties to my coworkers 😸

## Executable

Run all commands from the root directory (i.e. the one that contains `src/`).

To run tests for all valid Days: `cabal test`

Make sure to add your puzzle inputs to `data/Day${DAYNUMBER}/challenge_input.dat`
before running any of the solution commands below!

To get solutions for all valid Days: `cabal run`

To get solutions for a specific Day: `cabal run exes -- ${DAYNUMBER}`
